## Algorithm

In short, the algorithm is as follow: <br>
#### A. Color Conversion <br>
1. A series of RGB images are taken with a different value of exposure time. <br>
2. A set of new images (GS Images) is created by converting the RGB images to grayscale images and applying histogram equalization. <br>

#### B. Image Registration <br>
The images need to be aligned to cope with little spatial shifts between images because of shaking hands. <br>
1. The first GS image is taken as the frame of reference. Fourier transforms this image from spatial to frequency domain. Let's call this image "reference." <br>
2. For the rest of the GS images: <br>
- Fourier transforms the image from spatial domain to frequency domain.
- Obtains the normalized cross-correlation matrix by inverse Fourier transforming the cross-power spectrum between this image and the reference.
- The coordinate of the maximum value in this matrix reflects the shift in pixel coordinate between those two images.
- The source RGB image is then shifted based on this shift in pixel values. The resulting image is the output of image registration. <br>

#### C. Exposure Fusion
1. Mertens exposure fusion algorithm[<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/PG.2007.23" target="_blank">1</a>] is carried out using the first RGB image (RGB source of the reference) and all image registration's output as the input.
4. A Gaussian filter is applied to smooth out the resulting image.
